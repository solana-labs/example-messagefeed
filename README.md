# Message Feed on Solana

This project demonstrates how to use the [Solana Javascript API](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)
to build, deploy, and interact with programs on the Solana blockchain, implementing a simple feed of messages
To see the final product, go to https://solana-example-messagefeed.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started

First fetch the npm dependencies, including `@solana/web3.js`, by running:
```sh
$ npm install
```

### Select a Network
The example connects to a local Solana network by default.

To start a local Solana network run:
```bash
$ npm run localnet:update
$ npm run localnet:up
```

Solana network logs are available with:
```bash
$ npm run localnet:logs
```

For more details on working with a local network, see the [full instructions](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js#local-network).

Alternatively to connect to the public testnet, `export LIVE=1` in your
environment.  By default `LIVE=1` will connect to the
beta testnet.  To use the edge testnet instead define `export CHANNEL=edge' in
your environment (see [url.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-example-message-feed/tree/master/urj.js) for more)

### Build the BPF C program
```sh
$ V=1 make -C program-bpf-c
```
or
```
$ npm run build:bpf-c
```

Compiled files can be found in `dist/program`. Compiler settings are configured in the [Solana SDK](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/sdk/bpf/bpf.mk)

### Build the BPF Rust program
```sh
$ ./program-bpf-rust/build.sh
```
or
```
$ npm run build:bpf-rust
```

Output ELF file can be found in `dist/program`.

### Start the web server
The message feed program is deployed by the web server at `src/server.js`, so
start it first:
```sh
$ npm run start-server
```

### Run the Command-Line Front End
After building the program and starting the web server, you can view the current
message feed by running

```sh
$ npm run start
```

and post a new message with:
```sh
$ npm run start -- "This is a message"
```

### Run the WebApp Front End
After building the program and starting the web server, start the webapp
locally by running:
```sh
$ npm run dev
```
then go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
